# Introduction

I am actively authoring a book on various aspects of effective large scale agile adoptions. I am generally trying to avoid restating what others have already written about, and instead intend to refer readers to external content whenever it makes sense. This site gives me a place to organize this external content and references to the same.


Prior to publishing the book I will likely change the layout, move to a custom domain and make other similar cosmetic changes.
