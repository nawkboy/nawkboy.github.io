# Book Description

Implementing agile at scale starts with the right management attitudes and structures, but it doesn’t stop there. The waterfall mindset is often deeply embedded, and successful agile transformation requires a new understanding of how your organization works, not just a new set of processes for a few teams.

In *Forging Change*, James Carpenter cuts through the noise that often surrounds large-scale agile transformations to explain how agile theories play out in the real world. Part 1 focuses on agile deployment challenges, including different ways to spread the agile mindset and management practices that are crucial to success. In Part 2, he has assembled a collection of conceptual models, practical techniques, and real-world examples showing how healthy agile processes work in large organizations. These techniques will help you establish a real change in mindset, not just terminology.

* Push higher quality standards by ratcheting your definition of Done.
* Forecast releases for business use without violating agile principles.
* Encourage automated unit testing and other aspects of improved craftsmanship.
* Select the right Scrum Master when you can’t upend the organizational chart yet.

*Forging Change* provides a well of tested information, models, and examples that address these and other common challenges. The result is a dependable, practical resource you will turn to again and again as you work to achieve positive, lasting organizational change.
