# Introduction

I am actively authoring a book on various aspects of effective large scale agile adoptions. I am generally trying to avoid restating what others have already written about, and instead refer readers to external content whenever
it makes sense. 

I expect to use this site to collect a variety of reference content organized by book chapter in order to make life easier for the reader of a printed copy of the book. There is also a variety of general reference content I have which will be better shared online, than to take up precious printed pages.

Sincerely,
James Carpenter
Executive Agile Coach
