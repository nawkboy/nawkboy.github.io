# Russell Healy's GetKanban Simulation Game

Russell Healy of getKanban Limited in New Zealand has created a fantastic instructional board game called “getKanban”. You can read more details about the game at: https://getkanban.com/

This game is easily the most efficient way I know for people to learn Kanban at the next level of depth. I find players learn in three hours what would otherwise take more than a day to learn at the same level of depth. Such is the instructional power of a very effective simulation, which the getKanban game definitely is.

## Cost Considerations

Last time I checked, the newest version of the game was priced at $450/set. Each set can support 1 to 6 players, with 3 to 4 being the sweet spot. It is best to play competitively against at least one other team, so ideally you should buy at least two sets.

Long ago Healy generously made print files for version 2 of the game freely available, and continues to do so. Even the free version costs around $70/set after you pay for printing costs and supplies. The newer version is indeed slightly better, yet for many the price difference is hard to justify especially if you need a large number of game sets.

If funding is not an issue, please consider buying the commercial version. Although $450 per set sounds steep, I'm sure the price is easily justified in terms of Healy's development costs.


## Producing the Free Version

Producing a copy of the free version of getKanban V2 involves printing and laminating the board and pieces, and assembling a variety of off the shelf office supplies. With the information below you should be able to do this
in far less time than the day or so it originally took me.

### Printing the Board Set

Economically printing and laminating the print files is the most challeging and time consuming part of producing the game. Expect this part to be a bit fussy.

The v2 print files can be found at: https://getkanban.com/pages/free-version
Remember you are looking for Version 2, as Healy only provides a complete set of print files for version 2.

You will want to have all of the game pieces and the board laminated. Although dry-erase marker laminate is better, it is relatively pricey. As long as you have dry-erase cleaner, normal laminate is much cheaper and works almost as well.

I recommend you ask the print shop to print the blocker card on pink paper, and laminate it along with everything else. You will only need one of these per game set.

You are very likely to find an online print shop will have the lowest production cost, although an online shop is also likely going to be the most difficult to work with. The challenge is finding one which has both large format printing and lamination capability, and is willing to take the time to understand the order.

If your company has a sufficiently capable cost effective in-house print shop you can visit in person, I strongly recommend you take advantage of it.

Without a prototype example, a print shop will initially struggle to understand the order. I recommend you print and cut a copy of all the letter sized print files yourself. Showing your limited proto-type to the print shop will go a very long way in helping the print shop understand the order.

### Ordering Everything Else

Identifying and collecting all the various additional supplies required for each game can be tedious and time consuming. With the following list you can quickly order everything you need in just a few minutes.

+ **EXPO Low-Odor Dry Erase Markers, Fine Point, Assorted Colors, 12-Count**

  You will need one per game set. The colors in this specific expo pack align with the color codes used in the getKanban game materials.

  - EXPO Product ID: 86603
  - Amazon Link: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J0B2YY
  
+ **EXPO Low-Odor Dry Erase Markers, Fine Point, Black, 12-Count**

  You will need two additional black markers per game set. This box of 12 will therefore be enough for 6 game sets.

  - EXPO Product ID: 86001
  - Amazon Link: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006HXJFK
  
+ **EXPO Whiteboard / Dry Erase Board Liquid Cleaner, 8-ounce**

  The small 8-ounce bottles work well in a classroom setting. I have learned dry-erase marker cleaning liquids are not all created equal. Assuming your game pieces are laminated with the more economical standard laminate, using better dry erase liquid cleaner and better paper towels makes a noticeable difference.

+ **16mm d6 Dice: Red, Blue, Orange**
  
  Each game set will require 2 Orange dice, 2 Red Dice, and 3 Blue dice. Standard 16mm Six Sided Dice work great. Since people will lose them and mix them up across sets, I recommend you buy a few extra of each color and ensure consistency of brand and style.

  - **Chessex Dice d6 Sets: Opaque Red with White - 16mm Six Sided Die (12) Block of Dice**
    - Amazon Link: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011WMADQ

  - **Chessex Dice d6 Sets: Opaque Blue with White - 16mm Six Sided Die (12) Block of Dice**
    - Amazon Link: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011WHL4Y

  - **Chessex Dice d6 Sets: Oranage with White Translucent - 16mm Six Sided Die (12) Block of Dice**
    - Amazon Link: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RZN3VQ

  
+ **Gallon Sized Plastic Freezer Bags**

  You will need something to collect the various game pieces for each game set. A transparent gallon sized plastic freezer bag per game set works great. The freezer bags have thicker plastic and usually hold up better than the non-freezer versions.

  - Amazon Link (Ziplock): https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CQAHOCO
  
+ **Bounty Select-A-Size, Absorbent Paper Towel Roll**

  One roll will be more than you need a large number of game sets. Any brand of better kitchen paper towel will obviously work. The hard paper towels you find in the average office kitchen and restroom don't work well.

  - Amazon Link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXU4M87
  
+ **ScotchBlue Painter's Tape, Multi-Use, 0.94-Inch by 60-Yard, 1 Roll**

  The main game boards the print shop produces will inevitably curl up a bit. Painter's tape is fantastic for taping the game boards down to the table.

  - Amazon Link: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004Z4CP/
  
+ **Duffle Bag or Similar**

  You will also want a container to keep all your game sets together. An old suit case works well. An appropriately sized duffle bag can also work well. A laminated game board is a little over 24" tall. You are therefore looking a bag or suitcase which can easily hold several rolled up laminated game boards with an approximate diameter of 8" and approximately 25" in length. You will also need room for the various laminated letter sized sheets and a freezer bag of small stuff for each game set. 

  Whole Foods sometimes carries an inexpensive long shoulder bag which works well, although it looks like a diaper bag and frequently comes some very femine colors. A better choice can likely be found on Amazon with enough searching. Please let me know if you find an ideal choice.
  
  - Rolled Gameboard Length: 25 inches
  - Rolled Gameboard Diameter: 8 inches
  - Laminated sheets: Letter size (8.5"x11")

# Using the Free Version

## Slides

To help facilate the game, I have also produced a slide deck which makes it easier to walk people through the initial game round (Day 9). 

Russell Healy has generously incorporated this derivative work into the print file download bundle so you will find it at https://getkanban.com/pages/free-version along with the print files.

## Hacking getKanban

Cheryl Hammond provides an interesting perspective on using the getKanban game. My experience has not been the same as her's. In my experience, "Evil Carlos" has not adversely affected learning outcomes at all. I suspect your experience will vary based on the skills and background of the game participants.
