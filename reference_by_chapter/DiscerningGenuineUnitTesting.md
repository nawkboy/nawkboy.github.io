[Economy of Tests by Mathias Verraes](http://verraes.net/2015/01/economy-of-tests)
Provides a nice nuanced view of the advantages and disadvantages of each level of testing in the test pyramid. I particularly like how the author explains how the challenges of testing legacy code influence the compromises involved.


[“UnitTest” by Martin Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UnitTest.html)
Classic basic article explaining unit testing.
