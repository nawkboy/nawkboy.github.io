# Thiagi (Sivasailam Thiagarajan, Ph. D)

[Thiagi's Website](http://thiagi.com)

[Podcasts](http://www.thiagi.com/resources/#/podcasts-1/)
  + I particularly like Episode 8 and 9, which is a discussion between Guy Wallace and Thiagi regarding the advantages and disadvantages of heavy vs. light-weight instructional design.
  
[Ready to Use Games](http://www.thiagi.com/resources/#/games-3/)

[Archived Games from TGL](http://www.thiagi.com/game-list-test)
+ These are the ones I like the most, likely because they are the ones I originally spent a lot of time reading through before they changed up the website.

[Design Your Own Games and Activities: Thiagi's Templates for Performance Improvement](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787964654)
+ Thiagi has written a variety of books. This is the only one I own. I found the content generally useful although perhaps only marginally more useful than those listed at the Archived Games from TGL link above.
