# Training Concerns: Useful References

## Thiagi (Sivasailam Thiagarajan, PhD)

[Thiagi's website](http://www.thiagi.com)

[Podcasts](http://www.thiagi.com/resources/#/podcasts-1/)
  + I particularly like episodes 8 and 9, which are a discussion between Guy Wallace and Thiagi regarding the advantages and disadvantages of heavyweight vs. lightweight instructional design.
  
[Ready to Use Games](http://www.thiagi.com/resources/#/games-3/)

[Archived Games from TGL](http://www.thiagi.com/game-list-test)
+ These are the ones I like the most, likely because they are the ones I originally spent a lot of time reading through before they changed the website.

[*Design Your Own Games and Activities: Thiagi's Templates for Performance Improvement*](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787964654)
+ Thiagi has written a variety of books. This is the only one I own. I found the content generally useful although perhaps only marginally more useful than those listed at the "Archived Games from TGL" link above.
