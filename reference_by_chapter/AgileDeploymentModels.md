## Kotter Change Model

In his book [Leading Change](https://www.kotterinc.com/book/leading-change/), [John Kotter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kotter) puts forward a change model with the following stages:

* Establishing a Sense of Urgency
* Creating the Guiding Coalition
* Developing a Vision and Strategy
* Communicating the Change Vision
* Empowering Employees for Broad-Based Action
* Generating Short-Term Wins
* Consolidating Gains and Producing More Change
* Anchoring New Approaches in the Culture

The model is typically presented as a set of linear stages. The key is to recognize real life is far more complex. At any moment there are variety of concurrent changes happening, each in its own place in the sequence. Furthermore, a given activity might be influencing change on a variety of dimensions, each with active changes at a separate stage in the Kotter change model. As George Box famously said "All models are wrong, but some are useful."

The Kotter Change Model is a rather abstract change model intended for broad applicability to large variety of organizational change efforts. In contrast the change models discussed in Forging Change are specific to agile transformation efforts. So long as you open your mind to a less linear view of the Kotter change model, you will be able to recognize the Executive Pull Change Model described in Forging Change as a concrete realization of the Kotter Change Model. In other words, the Executive Pull Change Model is to the Kotter Change Model as a concrete Java class is to an interface it implements.

[Huge list of various Agile Assessments](https://www.benlinders.com/tools/agile-self-assessments/)

If you are a client of Agile Carpentry, I will be happy to show you an example of agile assessment structures I have used in the past. In my personal experience it is generally better to have a skillful expert help you craft an assessment specific to your organizational needs. The Agility Health Radar is very nice and inspirational, yet it doesn't do anything one can't do in Tableau or MS Excel just as effectively and typically at a lower cost.

### Organizational Maturity Models

#### Tribal Leadership Model

Tribal Leadership is an older book, and gets less mindshare these days than Reinventing Organizations by Frederic Laloux. The message of both books is somewhat the same.

[Random Google search result, I have not read this one carefully](https://www.isixsigma.com/community/blogs/understanding-five-stages-tribal-leadership/)

#### Reinventing Organizations Model

Reinventing Organizations is the more contemporary model in use within the agile community. I personally find it a little cleaner than the Tribal Leadership model although very similar in many ways.

+ Adkins/Spayd lecture introduces the concept using Laloux’s model. Towards the end they mention an organization is constrained by the level of thinking/mindset of the senior executive.

+ You will find the Holacracy folks frequenty reference Laloux's work. I’m not advocating Holacracy, I am simply pointing out it is important to recognize the close marketing connection between Laloux's and Robertson's work.
