# Sprint Alignment Wall: Useful References

[Visualizing the Nexus Sprint Backlog](https://www.scrum.org/resources/visualizing-nexus-sprint-backlog) by Rob Maher and Patricia Kong

+ The "Basic Sprint Alignment Wall" in my book is extremely close to what Rob Maher and Patricia Kong show in their "Figure 1. Cross-Team Refinement Board." My "Enhanced Sprint Alignment Wall" has epic-level and confidence-level indications that Maher and Kong's refinement board does not.

+ You will notice I have used different colors to highlight the direction of the dependency. In comparison, their color scheme indicates the cause of the dependency. I like their color code notation better than my own.

[Cross-Team Refinement](https://www.scrum.org/resources/cross-team-refinement-nexus) by Rob Maher and Patricia Kong

+ This is closely related to their "Visualizing the Nexus Sprint Backlog" article and resonates with my chapter on "Progressive Refinement at Scale."


[Useful Construction Materials](http://forgingchange.com/reference_info/UsefulConstructionMaterials)
+ This page details a variety of useful construction tools you are likely to need to easily create a Sprint Alignment Wall or other similar information radiator. I recommend ordering these supplies in advance.
