[Article on Cross-Team Refinement by Rob Maher and Patricia Kong](https://www.scrum.org/resources/cross-team-refinement-nexus)

+ The approach I described in the book provides a little more formalization which should prove helpful when coordinating across a larger group. In other regards, it is roughly identical to the process described by Rob Maher and Patricia Kong.

[Visualizing the Nexus Sprint Backlog by Rob Maher and Patricia Kong](https://www.scrum.org/resources/visualizing-nexus-sprint-backlog)

+ Closely related to their Cross-Team Refinement article and resonates with my Sprint Alignment Wall chapter. 


[Backlog Grooming Bugs Me by Jeff Patton](http://jpattonassociates.com/tag/grooming/)

+ Jeff Patton talks about the risks of boring unproductive refinement meetings and how to avoid them. [Jeff Patton](http://jpattonassociates.com) and [Roman Pichler](http://www.romanpichler.com) have long been the go to references for guidance regarding Product Ownership.

[Tips for Effective Backlog Grooming by Charles Bradley](http://www.scrumcrazy.com/Tips+for+Effective+Backlog+Grooming)

+ Excellent set of tips for effective backlog refinement by Charles. I don't remember ever disagreeing with anything Charles has said or written. Like myself Charles is or at least once was a hard-core software engineer and so speaks from real world experience.

### Reasonable Scaling Frameworks

Nexus and LeSS are very similar to each other, and largely codify behaviors and structure mature large scale Scrum teams have been employing for years.
