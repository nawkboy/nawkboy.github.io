#  Progressive Refinement at Scale: Useful References

Article on [Cross-Team Refinement](https://www.scrum.org/resources/cross-team-refinement-nexus) by Rob Maher and Patricia Kong

+ The approach I described in the book provides a little more formalization, which should prove helpful when coordinating across a larger group. In other regards, it is roughly identical to the process described by Rob Maher and Patricia Kong.

[Visualizing the Nexus Sprint Backlog](https://www.scrum.org/resources/visualizing-nexus-sprint-backlog), by Rob Maher and Patricia Kong

+ This article is closely related to their "Cross-Team Refinement" article and resonates with my "Sprint Alignment Wall" chapter. 


[Backlog Grooming Bugs Me](https://www.jpattonassociates.com/tag/grooming/), by Jeff Patton

+ Jeff Patton talks about boring, unproductive refinement meetings and how to avoid them. [Jeff Patton](https://www.jpattonassociates.com) and [Roman Pichler](https://www.romanpichler.com) have long been the go-to references for guidance regarding product ownership.

[Tips for Effective Backlog Grooming](http://www.scrumcrazy.com/Tips+for+Effective+Backlog+Grooming), by Charles Bradley

+ Charles provides an excellent set of tips for effective backlog refinement. I don't remember ever disagreeing with anything Charles has said or written. Like me, Charles is&mdash;or at least once was&mdash;a hard-core software engineer and so speaks from real-world experience.

### Reasonable Scaling Frameworks

Nexus and LeSS are very similar to each other, and largely codify behaviors and structure that mature large-scale Scrum teams have been employing for years.
