 [Kanban An Alternative Path to Agility by David J. Anderson](http://www.thepathtoagility.com/wp- content/uploads/2014/01/KanbanAltPathToAgility.pdf)

  + When Anderson talks about “Kanban” he is really talking about a whole lot more than flow control. His 6 Practices for Evolutionary DNA are:
    - Visualize
    - Limit Work-In-Progress
    - Manage Flow
    - Make Policies Explicit
    - Implement Feedback Loops
    - Improve Collaboratively, Evolve Experimentally (Using models & the scientific method)

  + There is somewhat of an on-going conflict between the hard-core Scrum folks and the hard-core Kanban/Lean folks. The Scrum folks believe the entrenched behavior is so broken as to require re-setting the foundations. The Kanban/Lean folks believe one should model existing process and slowly evolve and improve. I believe both views have merit, and the two views can be mutually compatible.
