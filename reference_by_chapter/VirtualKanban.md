[Complex Kanban Sequence](https://www.dropbox.com/s/deuooidw9vivpa9/ComplexKanbanSequence.pdf?dl=0)
+ Demonstrates card flow through a rather complex Virtual Kanban board.

[GetKanban Production Guide](http://forgingchange.com/reference_info/GetKanbanProductionGuide)
+ Provides instructions to help you more easily produce the free version of Russell Healy's fantastic GetKanban simulation game. There isn't a better way to learn Kanban basics. Buy the newest commercial version if you can afford it, otherwise use this guide to produce the free version in much less time than it originally took me to do so.

 [Kanban An Alternative Path to Agility by David J. Anderson](http://www.thepathtoagility.com/wp- content/uploads/2014/01/KanbanAltPathToAgility.pdf)

  + When Anderson talks about “Kanban” he is really talking about a whole lot more than flow control. His 6 Practices for Evolutionary DNA are:
    - Visualize
    - Limit Work-In-Progress
    - Manage Flow
    - Make Policies Explicit
    - Implement Feedback Loops
    - Improve Collaboratively, Evolve Experimentally (Using models & the scientific method)

  + There is somewhat of an on-going conflict between the hard-core Scrum folks and the hard-core Kanban/Lean folks. The Scrum folks believe the entrenched behavior is so broken as to require re-setting the foundations. The Kanban/Lean folks believe one should model existing process and slowly evolve and improve. I believe both views have merit, and the two views can be mutually compatible.
