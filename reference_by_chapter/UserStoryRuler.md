title: User Story Ruler: Useful References
---

The concept of affinity estimation, user story rulers, and use of reference stories are very closely related concepts. I frequently see these described using a variety of terminology. To my mind there isn't any significant danger of differing terminology causing significant confusion in this case, so I am happy with almost any terms people find useful. (I would never say this of a term such as "unit testing" in which lack of common understanding can be very problematic.)

Relevant Google search terms which might be useful for you:

 * Affinity Estimation
 * White Elephant Sizing (also: Elephant Board)
 * User Story Ruler
 * Reference User Story

[StandardStoryPoints](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StandardStoryPoints.html) by Martin Fowler discusses the dangers of trying to align story point values across teams.

I believe Fowler's points are correct for teams which would otherwise be working completely independently, enabled via independent code-bases or good continuous delivery behaviors. For teams working against a shared product backlog who must collaboratively conduct refinement, having some common shared sizing guidelines within the collaborating teams can be useful.

As discussed in my chapter on "Agile Design Elements", please never forget treating effort estimates as commitments will completely destroy quality, morale, transparency, and forecast accuracy.
